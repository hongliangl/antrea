// Package hostdp forwards the traffic between the Pods of two Nodes with eBPF instead of the host network
// stack, under the EBPFHostDataPath feature gate.
//
// It replaces one thing and one only: the "remotePodCIDR via peerNodeIP" routes pkg/agent/route installs in
// noEncap mode. A packet of a local Pod bound for a remote Pod, and the packets coming back, are sent
// straight to the other interface instead of going through routing and netfilter. Nothing else moves: the
// masquerade of the traffic leaving the cluster, Egress, Service handling and the Node network policies stay
// where they are, in iptables and in the OVS pipeline.
//
// Those routes are still installed while this runs. This datapath comes before them and, whenever it cannot
// handle a packet, leaves it to them, so a Node keeps forwarding exactly what it forwards without it. That is
// what makes it safe to turn on, and it is also what keeps it working: the neighbor entries it reads are
// resolved and refreshed by the kernel, which only does so for the packets it forwards itself.
//
// The programs live in bpf/hostdp.bpf.c. hack/gen-bpf-objects compiles them into objects_linux.go, so that
// the Agent binary carries the instructions and needs neither a compiler nor an eBPF library to load them.
